{
  "howToParseInputString": "The input string consists of multiple lines of space-separated integers. Each line represents a report. The levels within each report are separated by a single space (\" \").",
  "algorithm": [
    "Initialize a safe report counter.",
    "For each report in the input list, do the following:",
    "1. Split the report string into a list of integers.",
    "2. Check if the list of integers is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.",
    "   A sequence is considered strictly increasing if each subsequent integer is greater than the previous integer. \n   A sequence is considered strictly decreasing if each subsequent integer is less than the previous integer.",
    "3. For every adjacent pair of numbers in the report, check if the absolute difference is between 1 and 3 inclusive.",
    "4. If both conditions (either all increasing or all decreasing and the differences check) hold: increment the safe report counter.",
    "5. After processing all reports, return the count of safe reports."

Helper functions are used to encapsulate the logic for checking sequences and differences."
