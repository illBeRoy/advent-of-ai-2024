❌ Code did not pass code review!

Says:
  Changes made: 1. Removed unused and redundant functions which were causing type mismatch errors.
2. Simplified logic by combining meaningful steps into two main computational functions. The function now correctly calculates 'total distance' and 'total similarity score' according to the requirements, and returns both as a concatenated string.
