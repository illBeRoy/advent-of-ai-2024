‚úÖ Challenge description broken down. Algorithm expected to have 7 steps.

Thinks:
{
  "howToParseInputString": "To parse the input string, start with splitting the string into lines based on newline characters. This can be done using the split() method with '\\n' as the delimiter. After the split, we will primarily focus on extracting the relevant segments containing the character grid. The main word we need to search for, which is 'XMAS', will be treated separately later. Here's a breakdown of the steps needed: 1. Split the input string into lines using '\\n' as the delimiter. 2. Collect each line into a list to represent the grid. 3. Ensure that the grid is clean and contains only valid characters (letters) without leading or trailing whitespace, which can be accomplished using strip() on each line.",
  "algorithm": [
    "Initialize a variable to count occurrences of 'XMAS' to zero.",
    "Create a nested loop structure to iterate through each character in the grid.",
    "For each character in the grid, check if it matches the first character of the word 'XMAS'.",
    "If it matches, check in all eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and their opposite) for the complete occurrence of the word 'XMAS'.",
    "For each direction, verify that the entire word fits within grid boundaries before checking subsequent characters.",
    "If a complete match of 'XMAS' is found in the given direction, increment the count of occurrences.",
    "After iterating through all characters and directions, output the total count of occurrences of 'XMAS'."
