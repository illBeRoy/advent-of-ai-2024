  "howToParseInputString": "To parse the input string, look for valid mul instructions that follow the pattern 'mul(X,Y)', where X and Y are 1 to 3 digit numbers. Valid instructions are those that are not corrupted by invalid characters. Examples of valid and invalid instructions in the context are: 'mul(3,7)' is valid; 'mul(3,7)!' or 'mul(3,7)^' are invalid due to the additional characters. Start by replacing any sequence that doesn't match 'mul(\\d{1,3},\\d{1,3})' with an empty string.",
  "algorithm": [
    "Initialize a sum to 0, which will hold the result of all valid multiplications.",
    "Set a boolean variable enabled to true, to track whether mul instructions are currently enabled.",
    "Split the input string based on the valid instructions by using regex matching for 'mul(\\d{1,3},\\d{1,3})' and 'do()'/'don't()' instructions.",
    "For each element in the split list:",
    "  - If it matches 'do()', set enabled to true.",
    "  - If it matches 'don't()', set enabled to false.",
    "  - If it matches 'mul(X,Y)' and enabled is true, parse X and Y, multiply them, and add the result to the sum.",

  "reasoning": "The code defines an asynchronous function `solver` that processes a string input to calculate the sum of products from valid 'mul(X,Y)' instructions, respecting 'do()' and 'don't()' commands that control whether multiplications should be performed. It uses regular expressions for extracting and validating instructions and manages state through a boolean variable to enable or disable multiplication."
