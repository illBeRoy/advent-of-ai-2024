  "howToParseInputString": "Each line of the input string represents a separate report. Each report consists of numbers separated by spaces. The delimiter to split the lines is \"\\n\" and to split the numbers within a report is \" \".",

    "For a sequence to be strictly increasing or decreasing, each number must differ from the next by at least 1 and at most 3. If it does, increment a safe report counter.",
    "If the report is not safe, attempt to find if removing one level from the report can make it safe. Try removing each level and check again for the safety conditions.",
